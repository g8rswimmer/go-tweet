# go-twitter
This is a go library for Twitter v2 API integration.

In order to use or demo this library, you need a developer account with twitter.  If you do not have an account, please go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en).  Please understand that by using this library, you are using under the terms which twitter has defined.

## API Reference
The library is based off of [version 2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) of Twitters API.  At the time of creation, the APIs are early access.  Please be aware that as the APIs are built out, the library may lag behind.

## Examples
To run all examples, the user is required to provide their developer account credentials.  The library does not share any credentials.

### Tweet Lookup
The tweet lookup API example is located [here](./_examples/tweet/lookup).
